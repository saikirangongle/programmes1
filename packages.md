# *[Python - Packages](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-package)*


We organize a large number of files in different folders and subfolders based on some criteria, so that we can find and manage them easily. In the same way, a package in Python takes the concept of the modular approach to next logical level. As you know, a module can contain multiple objects, such as classes, functions, etc. A package can contain one or more relevant modules. Physically, a package is actually a folder containing one or more module files.


Let's create a package named mypackage, using the following steps:
<l1>1.Create a new folder named D:\MyApp.</l1>
<l2>2.Inside MyApp, create a subfolder with the name 'mypackage'.</l2>
<l3>3.Create an empty __init__.py file in the mypackage folder.</l3>
<l4>4.Using a Python-aware editor like IDLE, create modules greet.py and functions.py.</l4>

That's it. We have created our package called mypackage. The following is a folder structure:
